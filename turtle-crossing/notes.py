#Turtle Crossing Game
#player controls turtle to cross the screen going forward amidst random car traffic going in right angle to turtle,
#ie across the screen horizontally R to L.
#Game over when turtle collides with car
#each level the cars speed up

#
# 1. A turtle moves forwards when you press the "Up" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.
# 2. Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.
# 3. When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up.
#    On the next level, the car speed increases.
# 4. When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.
